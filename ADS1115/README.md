# ADS1115
Almost all microcontrollers come with ADC pins, but they lack high precision. In a lot of projects, analog values need to be measured with high accuracy, or the voltage level of the measured signal is not within the microcontroller measurement range, or even the microcontroller used doesnâ€™t have an ADC pin. In such cases, analog to digital converter modules are used.
ADS1115 module is an analog to digital converter module that has 16-bit precision and can measure a maximum voltage of 7 volts. This module uses I2C communication protocol, so it has a high speed and occupies a small number of the microcontroller pins.
